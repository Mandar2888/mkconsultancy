  <h1 class="text-center mb-3">Terms of Use</h1>
  <p class="text-center text-muted mb-4">WhatsApp Business API usage — MK Management Consultancy LLP</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
    <p>By using the WhatsApp Business API services provided by <strong>MK Management Consultancy LLP</strong> ("we", "us" or "our"), you agree to these Terms of Use ("Terms") and any policies referenced herein. If you do not agree, do not use the service.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>2. Scope of Service</h3>
    <p>We provide access to messaging and related API features to enable automated and programmatic communication with your customers via WhatsApp. The features available depend on whether you use the <em>Cloud API</em>, a third-party Business Solution Provider (BSP), or a self-hosted/on-premises API client.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>3. Account Setup and Phone Number</h3>
    <p>You are responsible for providing accurate information during onboarding and for the phone number(s) you connect. Phone numbers must be verified with Meta/WhatsApp and may require a certificate or registration token depending on your hosting arrangement. Do not share certificate files or private credentials with unauthorized parties.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>4. Payment, Billing and Add Funds</h3>
    <p>Messaging and platform charges are billed by Meta (or by your BSP). You must maintain a valid payment method and sufficient prepaid balance where applicable. Refunds, currency-specific minimums, and billing disputes are subject to Meta's billing policies and your BSP agreement.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>5. Message Templates and Content</h3>
    <p>Transactional or templated messages must comply with WhatsApp's template and policy rules. You are responsible for submitting templates for approval and ensuring message content is lawful, non-deceptive, and not in violation of WhatsApp or local regulations.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>6. Compliance with Laws &amp; WhatsApp Policies</h3>
    <p>All use of the WhatsApp Business API must comply with applicable laws, data protection regulations (for example, the IT Act and applicable privacy laws in India), and WhatsApp's Commerce and Business policies. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate service for violations.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>7. Data Handling &amp; Privacy</h3>
    <p>We process message data solely to deliver messaging services. Where we act as a data processor, you remain the data controller and must ensure you have legal grounds to process personal data. See our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details on data collection, use, and retention. Sensitive personal data must not be shared via message templates.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>8. Security</h3>
    <p>You must keep API credentials, certificates, and tokens secure. If you suspect any compromise, revoke the credentials immediately and notify us. We will take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data, but cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>9. Acceptable Use</h3>
    <p>You must not use the service to send spam, illegal content, or messages that violate WhatsApp policy. Bulk unsolicited messaging, phishing, hateful content, or content infringing third-party rights is strictly prohibited.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>10. Limitation of Liability</h3>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising out of your use of the API. Our aggregate liability for direct damages is limited to the fees you paid us for the service in the preceding 12 months.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>11. Termination</h3>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate access to the API if you breach these Terms, violate WhatsApp policies, or for legal/regulatory reasons. On termination, you must stop using the API and we may delete associated data as permitted by applicable law.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>12. Changes to Terms</h3>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be notified by posting an updated version and, where appropriate, by direct notice. Continued use of the service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>13. Contact</h3>
    <p>For questions about these Terms, onboarding, billing or support, contact us at <a href="mailto:mkoffice@gmail.com">mkoffice@gmail.com</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="muted-note">
    <strong>Note:</strong> These Terms are supplemental to Meta/WhatsApp's own terms and developer policies. You must also comply directly with Meta's terms at the time you register and use the WhatsApp Business API.
